<h1>Valorant Agents Information Repository</h1>
Welcome to the Valorant Agents Information Repository! This project aims to provide detailed information on every agent in the popular tactical shooter game, Valorant, developed by Riot Games. Whether you're a new player looking to understand each agent's abilities or a veteran seeking in-depth details, this repository has you covered.
Valorant is a 5v5 character-based tactical shooter where each agent has unique abilities and plays a specific role within the team. This repository organizes information about all agents into clear and concise sections to help players learn and strategize.
This section provides a quick overview of all agents, categorized by their roles: Duelists, Initiators, Sentinels, and Controllers.
Duelists: Agents who specialize in attacking and fragging.
Initiators: Agents who excel at breaking through defenses and starting engagements.
Sentinels: Agents focused on defensive play and protecting allies.
Controllers: Agents who manipulate the battlefield with their abilities.
Each agent has a dedicated markdown file containing detailed information about their abilities, and lore. The agents are grouped based on their roles.
Here are some pages of what it looks like:
